Assignement 1: The Game of Nim
#The game of "Nim" is played with two players.  A game begins with 15 sticks laid out in a row.  
Players take turns removing sticks.  On your turn you must remove either one, two, or three sticks. 
The player who removes the last stick is the loser.
#NimMatch plays multiple games of NimGame and keeps track of overall score
